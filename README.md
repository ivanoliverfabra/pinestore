## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to fetch project data:

```typescript
import { Pinestore, Project, Comment, User } from 'pinestore';

async function main() {
  try {
    // Fetch a single project by ID
    const project: Project = await Pinestore.fetchProject(123);
    console.log(`Fetched Project: ${project.name} by ${project.owner_name}`);
    console.log(`Description: ${project.description_short}`);

    // Fetch all projects
    const allProjects: Project[] = await Pinestore.fetchProjects();
    console.log(`Total projects available: ${allProjects.length}`);

    // Search for projects
    const searchResults: Project[] = await Pinestore.searchProjects('my-game');
    console.log(
      `Search for "my-game" returned ${searchResults.length} results.`
    );

    // Fetch comments for a project
    const comments: Comment[] = await Pinestore.fetchComments(project.id);
    if (comments.length > 0) {
      console.log(`First comment on ${project.name}: ${comments[0].body}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`No comments found for ${project.name}.`);
    }

    // Fetch a user by Discord ID
    const user: User = await Pinestore.fetchUser('some_discord_id_here'); // Replace with actual Discord ID
    console.log(`Fetched User: ${user.name}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    // You can handle different error types or display user-friendly messages
  }
}

main();
```
